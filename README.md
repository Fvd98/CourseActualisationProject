# SchoolProgramUpdateProject

This was the project my classmate and I had to complete for our final course.

It was developed with ASP.NET Core, with C# as the backend and Razor/HTML/JavaScript/CSS/JQuery/Ajax for the frontend. Also, we designed the backend database (SQL Server) from scratch according to a client's needs.
